## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
#| label: setup
#| include: false

library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(readxl) 
library(dplyr) 
library(tidyr) 
library(lubridate) 
library(readxl) 
library(readr) 
library(janitor) 
library(tidyverse)
library(markdown)
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
read_csv (here::here("Data /raw/Durban_Informal_Settlement_Programme.csv"),
           show_col_types = FALSE)

```

```{r}
ethekwini_informal_Settlements <- read_csv (here::here("Data /raw/Durban_Informal_Settlement_Programme.csv"),
           show_col_types = FALSE)
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

Project description

This data contains all of the informal settlements registered by the eThekwini municipality. It containes the services provided by the municipality in terms of sanitation, electricity, refusal waste collection and the location details. This data is to be used by the different municipality departments for future planning.

I am using this data to categorise the services provided by the municipality within the settlements and to see if there plans to improve service delivery.
